    <h1> Nick Foles Speech </h1>
    <h4 id="top" class="italic"> after Super Bowl LII</h4>
  <hr style="width:75%">
    <p>
    <span class="italic underline">Failure is a part of life.</span> That's a part of building character and growing.
    Like, without failure, who would you be? I wouldn't be up here if I
    hadn't fallen thousands of times, made mistakes. We all are human.
    <span class="italic underline">We all have weaknesses.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
    <span class="italic underline">I'm not perfect</span> â€” I'm not Superman, I might be in the NFL, and we might have
    just won the Super Bowl, but hey, we still have daily struggles.
    I have daily struggles. But that's where my faith comes in.
    That's where my family comes in.

    I think when you look at a struggle in your life, just know that that's
    just an opportunity for your character to grow. And that's really just been
    the message. Simple. Like, if something's going on in your
    life and you're struggling, embrace it,
    <span class="italic underline"> because you're growing.</span>
