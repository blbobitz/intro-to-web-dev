  Dr. Emmett Brown</div>
  <div class="right">On November 5, 1955, Doc was standing on the
    edge of his toilet, while hanging a clock in his bathroom. But the porcelain
    was wet, making Doc slip, fall and hit his head on the sink. When Doc
    came to, he had a vision of the flux capacitor in his head, and drew a crude
    schematic diagram as well as scrawling some hurried calculations. The
    capacitor was constructed afterward and completed in 1985.</div>

Car Works</div>
<div class="right1">The operator is seated inside the DeLorean and turns on the
  time circuits by turning a handle near the gear lever, activating a unit
  containing multiple fourteen- and seven-segment displays that show the
  destination (red), present (green), and last departed (yellow) dates and
  times. After entering a target date with the keypad inside the
  DeLorean, the operator accelerates the car to 88 miles per hour, which
  activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the
  body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. <p>
  Surrounded by an electrical current similar to a Tesla coil, the whole car
  vanishes in a flash of white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of
  fiery tire tracks. A digital speedometer is attached to the dashboard
  so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed.</p> </div>
